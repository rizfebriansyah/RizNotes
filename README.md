# Project Name: RizNotes
Description: A simple day to day note taking app

RizNotes aims to be a user friendly note taking app where users can jot down their thoughts/ideas or simply anything anywhere and anytime.
The market is very saturated, yet some are very complicated and rich with features. I would want to just to create an app which just works, simple yet minimalistic, allowing users to just create notes on the go, and stored locally. 

Technologies used: Javascript, React, Expo

Features: Add note, search for notes, edit notes, delete notes
