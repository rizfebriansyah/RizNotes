# Project Name: RizNotes

Description: A simple day to day note taking app

RizNotes aims to be a user friendly note taking app where users can jot down their thoughts/ideas or simply anything anywhere and anytime.
The market is very saturated, yet some are very complicated and rich with features. I would want to just to create an app which just works, simple yet minimalistic, allowing users to just create notes on the go, and stored locally. 

Technologies used: Javascript, React, Expo


Features: Add note, search for notes, edit notes, delete notes

Complete report on the steps and process of RizNotes can be found here [RizNotes_MD_Report.pdf](https://github.com/rizfebriansyah/RizNotes/files/9816659/RizNotes_MD_Report.pdf)
